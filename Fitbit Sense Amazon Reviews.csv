Best Fitbit yet,5,Upgraded from Versa 2. Love the new features including ECG and Blood Oxygen Monitor.
Do not recommend.,1,Do not buy this. It is an exceptionally poor product with a garbage heart rate sensor. How fitbit allowed such an inferior product to be sold I have no idea. The side button regularly activates unintentionally when pressed against the wrist but fails to press when you try to. The screen regularly fails to register swipes. But by far the most egregious design failure is the heart rate sensor. The whole workout it registered way off as demonstrated in the image.Professional reviews all made the same points but i assumed they were overstated or were software fixes that would be worked out. I was wrong. I will be returning the watch and getting a Garmin.

Not Impressed Whatsoever!,2,Pretty much a letdown overall. My main disappointment is that it doesn't come with the ECG or the Google Assistant available! These were the two main functions I bought it forxxxxx and was advertised that it had. It can be hard to find my phone and sync at times. The sp02 feature only works with one specific clock face so it must be in use before you go to bed at night for it to work (bummer). The new charger is really good and easily usedxxxxx and changing bands only takes only seconds. Fit and finish are impeccable. I was told be Fitbit's tech support that there was a 45 day return window from the "date of purchase"xxxxx which was the date that you pre-ordered. I didn't actually get the watch for about a month from that date though! That means I've only got about a 15 day period in which to evaluate it then! Plusxxxxx Fitbit charges your card or account the day you place the pre-orderxxxxx that sucks. Most companies charge you only when an item shipsxxxxx the decent thing to do. I've found Fitbit's tech support agents are very hard to communicate with because English is apparently not their first language. I'm still debating sending my unit back depending upon how long it takes to get these advertisedxxxxx but not providedxxxxx functions up and running as well as numerous little bug fixesxxxxx but I'll have to hurry! By the wayxxxxx I purchased mine from Fitbitxxxxx not Amazon.
The main feature I wantedxxxxx GPSxxxxx doesn't work.,1,GPS doesn't work. It states "GPS connecting..." thenxxxxx after a minutexxxxx "No GPS Signal". I've used GPS to track my daily bike rides on my Versa 2. I was hopingxxxxx by getting the Sensexxxxx I wouldn't have to lug my phone around with me anymore. I've contacted Fitbit Support. The first representative wasn't able to assist. They escalated the issue to a "special team". Now I'm waiting on the next tier of support to reach out to me. I'm leaving a 1-star review for nowxxxxx seeing that the major reason I bought this device -- built-in GPS -- doesn't function at all. I've been a Fitbit customer for years (having the Versa 1xxxxx Versa 2xxxxx and smart scales) so I hate to say that I'm disappointed in this product. But I am extremely disappointed.
So disappointed,1,I was so excited to receive my Fitbit sense since I suffer from SVT and like to keep close watch on my heart rate...what a huge disappointment. For the money spent it was so hard to use and not accurate. I sent mine back and will be looking into an Apple Watch 5 or 6.
Unethical Upsells in Set up,2,So far the watch itself seems OKxxxxx but Fitbit burned me as a customer in the set up process. Not oncexxxxx but twice during set up the user is presented with upsell screens (insurance and premium service) for which there is only an OK button to move on. You have to back out of the screen and dismiss a warning to avoid buying the upgrade and thenxxxxx the watch did not leave set up mode until after updating (warning may take more than 20 minutesxxxxx and yesxxxxx 90 is more than 20. Ninety minutes during which you have to leave the phone on the Fitbit app's update screen and so cannot use your phone)
It's just not worth it,1,Spare yourself the waste and buy something cheaper. Its interface is sloppyxxxxx slowxxxxx it loses connection frequently and it fails to add a cc for payments... not greater than a band you can get for 200 less. The app is horrible (first time I use fitbit) I bought it as a gift so I'm returning itxxxxx I just pitty its owner. It demands a hideous amount of time to setup and an ugly more to get it to work if you're unlucky to drop comms phone to watch. I got frustrated just by using it for 10 minutes. It lacks value for its price.
All those sensors and nowhere to read results,2,I got watch yesterday. It is a mystery how to get readings of anything. I got so I can track myself morexxxxx this thing so far is doing significantly less then my amazfit bip. All negative reviews are right. It is cool you added all those sensors but it is next to impossible to read them. I barely can get heart ratexxxxx watch is unresponsive. Unless I can figure it out quicklyxxxxx I might be returning it. Previous fitbit was amazing experiencexxxxx I don't know what they did to make this
Best Fitbit yet,5,Upgraded from Versa 2. Love the new features including ECG and Blood Oxygen Monitor.
Stay away from this one!,1,I have used a Fitbit Ionic for about 4 years now. Of course it failed under warrantyxxxxx the Ionic had several known issuesxxxxx some of them kind of strangexxxxx like one I hadxxxxx the magnet inside the watch that holds the charge connector in place must have movedxxxxx and after that it repelled the connectorxxxxx instead of attracting it. Butxxxxx Fitbit would always send me a refurbxxxxx and didn't even want the defective one back. They actually did this about 4 timesxxxxx even after it was way out of warranty. I guess they knew they had a watch that had some issuesxxxxx so this was their way of standing behind the product. Soxxxxx when the Sense came outxxxxx I thought I would give it a try. Big mistake. The heart rate monitor is not capable of tracking any heart rate above around 110. The pictures I included should say it all. the first one is from my Ionic. the second one is from the Sensexxxxx same machinexxxxx same settingsxxxxx but as you can seexxxxx far different readings. No questionxxxxx there is an issuexxxxx just check the Sense forum in the Fitbit community on their web site. Is it hardwarexxxxx or something that can be fixed in software? I have no ideaxxxxx but am not interested in paying $350 to be an alpha tester. Mine is going back. And by the wayxxxxx when I called to get my return authorizationxxxxx I was put on hold several timesxxxxx and they wanted me to continue trying to work through the issue with customer support. I will never consider another Fitbit productxxxxx ever again.
So farxxxxx so good,5,I was concerned after all the early negative reviews but found the set-up (and update) process to be quick and easy (grantedxxxxx I am a prior Fitbit user and used the phone app to swap my devices - very easy). GPS worked although took a bit of time to connect - connecting time is getting better on each walk (I read somewhere that it would take more time the first few times using it). My heart rate is tracking the same as with my prior Fitibit (same resting / increase in rate during exercisexxxxx etc.) - no major changes. The band is comfortable but I have purchased a metal magnetic band that should be arriving today (same type I had on the Versa 2). Overallxxxxx I'm happy (and hoping that it stays that way).
If you’ve been a Fitbit fanxxxxx you’ll like this one too,4,I have worn Fitbit devices for years. I have found this one to be the most accurate so far. Seems very reliable when it comes to stepsxxxxx flightsxxxxx active minutesxxxxx heart rate and especially sleep tracking. The EKG app and overnight oxygen saturations are very interesting to me as a physicianxxxxx and I could see this being useful to someone with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or sleep apnea to track the activity of those conditions. Like othersxxxxx I wish there was an option to check oxygen saturation on demand rather than just overnight- perhaps in the next update? Finallyxxxxx it was easy to set upxxxxx charges quickly and retains battery life nicely and hasn’t given me any trouble connecting to my iPhone. Works better in all regards than my old Fitbit Blaze which finally stopped reliably charging after several years of daily use and abuse. If you like Fitbit devices and are used to their interfacexxxxx you should enjoy this new device.
Mostly great! A few nitpicks,4,I'm a long time Fitbit customer. I previously owned Versaxxxxx and Versa2. Prior to that I had a couple of Pebble smartwatches. So I quickly upgraded to Sense when it became available. All the features I love about Fitbit watchesxxxxx sleep statsxxxxx fitness statsxxxxx continuous heart ratexxxxx notificationsxxxxx are there and working very well. Initially I found the new UI a bit confusing. Not having the physical 'Back' button on the watch set me back a bit. I struggled for a while on how to get back to the watch face from various situations. Things improved much better when I eventually discovered the "VIRTUAL BACK" button. If you gently press the middle left side of the watchxxxxx it gives you a haptic feedback and puts you right back to the previous screen. Otherwise most existing features work similarly. Swipe to the leftxxxxx you get the application list. Swipe down you get the notifications. Swipe up you get the enhanced fitness statistics as well as weather widget and EDA widget. Fitness stats have been broken into two: CORE and ADVANCED. You have to load the ADVANCED stats separately if you want to see it all. NEW FEATURES: If you swipe to the rightxxxxx you get the most commonly used settings. 'Do not disturb'xxxxx 'Sleep'xxxxx 'Always on'xxxxx 'On when arm moves' buttons as well as watch face dimmer and music volume. These are very useful to have easy access to. I'm keeping the 'Always on' mode on at all times and turn off the 'On when arm moves' setting. This way I can always see the time at a glance and use the 'virtual back button' to light up the watch face when I want. I put my watch to sleep mode before going to bed. I use the virtual back button to wake the watch up and turn off the sleep mode when I wake up. With these settingsxxxxx my battery lasts about 5 days. ECG: This is an app in the application list. When you want to take your 30 second ECGxxxxx you start the appxxxxx place two fingers on the watch face corners and let the watch measure your ECG. After 30 seconds measurementxxxxx the watch tells you if you had a-fib during the 30 second time it took the measurement. It doesn't continuously monitor your heart rate looking for a-fib. I guess the idea is when you are not feeling well or having heart palpitationsxxxxx you will manually start this app and measure it. SKIN TEMP: The watch measures your skin temperature while you sleep and compares it to your baseline temperature. The idea is that a large variation in your sleep temperature may be an early indication that you are soon to get sick. EDA: Allows you to relax and measure your stress level for two minutes at a time. Afterwards it gives you a number indicating your stress level. You can also log your mood periodically and the Fitbit app keeps track of it. I find this feature marginally useful if at all. CHARGER: The new charger is much smaller and slimmer than the old versas. It has four small pins that connect to the watch on the back side. It reminds me of those old pebble watch chargersxxxxx where after a while dirt and sweat got in between the pins and contact with the watch became difficult. I had to frequently wipe clean the charger and the backside of the watch with wet wipes so that it could continue to charge. It remains to be seen if this new charger will develop those same problems as old pebble watches. I was hoping for touchless chargexxxxx like those of apple watches. Unfortunately not in this release...
Most comfortable fitbit I've worn. Love the screen and the options.,5,Very easy to set up. Comfortable to wear. Will know alot more after 3rd night's sleep. So farxxxxx so good.
Can't quite understand all the negative reviews.....,5,I really had to hesitate on this purchase based on all the negative reviewsxxxxx but I purchased the Fitbit Sense anyway thinking I could return it if I experienced similar problems mentioned by reviewers. I have had no problems at all and really like the device. GPS works great....battery life is goodxxxxx everything works as it shouldxxxxx although music playing is a little challenging. Not sure you HAVE to pay (one way or the other) to listen to music. Didn't buy a watch to listen to music anywayxxxxx so I don't consider it to be a big deal.....I really like the Sense and would recommend to anyone. This is an update.......If you want a smartwatch that is capable of listening to music - look elsewhere.....The whole concept of listening to music is lacking in this device...my research shows hundreds of customers who are not happy with this product in terms of being able to download and listen to Pandoraxxxxx Spotify and/or Deezer.......ugh (enough said).
Overall good watch but disappointed in "speaker" that only works with one watch function,3,I was so excited that FitBit was finally adding a speaker to their watches so it has the features and functions of a typical watch and more closely compared to the Samsung and Apple smart watches. I had a Versa 2 and was pretty happy with it but the thought of the speaker and being able to answer phone calls and talk from my watch instead of having to dash to my phone to answer and having an alarm clock and stopwatch with an audible alert made it a fairly easy decision to upgrade. Got the watch and when it powered up it made a welcome little tone....then nothing ever again. I discovered once I owned it that the only thing the audio works for is for music (and the welcome tone when you turn it on)xxxxx which is ridiculous that you would want to listen to music from a speaker in your watch (helloxxxxx Bluetooth headphones...). Why spend the extra effort and money to fit a speaker into a watch to only have it work for one function within the watch that most people couldn't care less about. I feel a bit cheated and letdown by FitBit. If you have a Versa 2 or similar don't waste your money on the upgrade. Maybe they will update their OS to allow more audio features but until thenxxxxx if you are looking for a watch with a speakerxxxxx just wait and don't waste your money.
Don’t buy yet. Needs a few updates,1,Has issues with tracking Heart Rate correctly and doesn’t include all advertised features...yet. Fitbit support hasn’t been able to help other than state that firmware updates are on the way.
Like my new Fitbit Sense,5,I like my new Fitbit Sense so far. I wore other Fitbit models for the past 6 years but this is my first smart watch. I changed to this one because I wanted an HD screen that was easier to read and I was intrigued by the health features. The face is very easy to read and there are lots of clock faces to choose from. The only thing I struggle with is how large it is. It rubs on the bone in my wrist a little but not much I can do to prevent it. They also need more band options for people who play sports. All in all I am happy with the Sense and am enjoying reading about the health related information it provides. Update: I have now had my new Sense for over a month. I love it. After about 2 weeks it no longer bothered the bone on my wrist. It is worth getting a cover for the glass if you are really active (like the covers for a cell phone). I cracked my screen already.
What a great watch. Sorry I had to return it.,5,The Fitbit Sense had everything I wanted in a watch. Fitness tracking and health tracking both worked well. Abundant watch faces to customize the face and a band that I think was better than the apple sport bands. I liked that it fit under a long sleeve shirt without crowding your arm. The display is clear and easy to read. The battery life is excellent. The app works well. The things I didn’t like were the position of the button on the left hand side. It is hard to reach and several attempts are needed sometimes to get it to respond. The face sometimes needs several attempts when you are trying to swipe to get it to react. These two things are not dealbreakers to me but I will tell you why I took it back. One of the features I bought the watch for was the o2 sensor. It works and I was using it for tracking o2 levels during sleep. I didn’t mind too much that you could only use one watch face to track o2 and it is easy to switch watch faces back and fourth. The thing that made me mad was the only way you could track the o2 reading was to upgrade to Fitbit premium. I just paid $330 for a watch and they want to charge me a monthly fee to track information that was one of the reasons I bought the watch. I don’t think so. Why didn’t they tell me this in the Fitbit add. I paid the extra money for the Apple Watch Series 6 and I couldn’t be happier.
Do NOT buy!!!,1,Honestly I was expecting big things from this watchxxxxx I thought it would be a step up from the apple watch but it is multiple steps back. To activate the "home" button you have to squeeze the sidesxxxxx which is no big deal unless you actually move your wrist. Every time you move your wrist it hits the home button and cancels your workout. The app is hard to use and I am actually tech savyxxxxx the watch has glitched multiple times and just froze for a couple hours and wouldn't go backxxxxx and the battery life is maybe 2 days definitely not 6. I cannot say this enoughxxxxx do not buy this watch!! I'm extremely disappointed by the design flaws and overall product.
Fitbit literally has changed my life.,5,Fitbit literally has changed my life. I have lost around 50 poundsxxxxx switched to a healthier lifestyle. That device is ahead of time and it beats all the competitors.
Wasted $500xxxxx terrible customer service to a customer who has had fitbits for nearly a decade,1,I've been a loyal fitbit customer for nearly a decade. I like the app and battery lifexxxxx but the smart watches have always been a bit glitchy (the text/calendar notifications have never worked consistently across 2 versas and the sense). Even soxxxxx I bought the Sense immediately after it came outxxxxx spent extra money on warranty protections and wristbands. Not even 3 weeks after I received itxxxxx I clanged my arm into one of those light aluminum patio chairs while grabbing my bagxxxxx and the screen chipped and cracked. I wrote Fitbit and they told me since it was my faultxxxxx there was nothing they could do for me. That's a terrible customer service policy on a new product that didn't withstand normal wear and tear bought by a longtime customer.
Wait for the next version they have bugs to work out,2,I’ve been a fit bit user since 2015. I love the ap! Soxxxxx it was time to upgrade my versaxxxxx I choose the sense. My first issue is the charger. It wouldn’t connect properly. Soxxxxx I contacted Fitbit support. They are going to send me a new chargerxxxxx but I have to send the old one back first. I’m looking at 3 weeks before I can use my new watch? It only came with a 60% charge. Um really! I went on the Fitbit trouble shooting forums and this is happening to a lot of people. It won’t charge out of the box. My second issue is the flush buttons. It takes a minute to get used to them. More of a pain in the ass. They aren’t very responsive. I suggest getting the Versa until they can work the kinks out on the sense. You are paying a lot of money for this. I haven’t made the switch to Apple because I love the ap and I mainly use mine for fitness. My fiancé has the Apple but playing around with itxxxxx I feel they spread all the stuff Fitbit has in one app over too many apps to easily access it. Hope this helps anyone whose thinking of purchasing. Toodles and happy shopping!
Too expensive for buggy and subpar results,3,I ordered Fitbit Sense for all the advanced tracking and measuring of SpO2 levelsxxxxx scared I may have gotten infectedxxxxx but it's not as good as I expected. SpO2 tracking supposedly only works when you sleep (WTH Fitbitxxxxx can't you help during COVID-19 times?) but it never showed anything on my watch. I wanted this instead of an Apple or Samsung watch because I like the fact that I don't have to charge it every night. Fortunatelyxxxxx I don't have COVID-19xxxxx but a $300+ watch shouldn't give intermittent but way too frequent troubles with screen not turning on upon wrist turn. This functionality works much better on my cheapxxxxx old faithful Amazfit Bip and I'm going back to itxxxxx using Runkeeper on myphone for exercise tracking. This is so going back.
Very Disappointed,1,This is my third (and last) Fitbit. The first two died within months of the warranty expiring. I took a chance on the Sense for its health monitoring features. The SpO2 only works while you sleepxxxxx only on one watch face and provides a result about 2 out of 3 times and then is consistently 4% to 6% off when compared to an SpO2 instrument. The EDA scan has yet to work after many tries. The ECG only provides normal or not normalxxxxx no tracing. GPS is finicky but generally does not work. It's pretty and that's about all the good I can say about it. The good news is that it will probably only last a little over a year like the others so then I can get an Apple watch. Edit: The SpO2 has not been able to provide a reading the past 12 nights.
Major disappointment,1,Versa 2 was good. The Fitbit sense is a messy pile of bugs. Initial setup process was super jankyxxxxx failed to update several times and the watch is unusable during this process. Always on display doesn't work. When you go into the display settings the brightness goes super low and the settings doesn't seem to do anything.
manage stressxxxxx heart health; take responsibility for your own health.,5,I have been using Fitbit products for several years. This one takes it a step further. The Fitbit Sense comes with a learning curvexxxxx as it is a complex instrument. I am still learning how to use it. If you can handle a smart phonexxxxx and a mobile appxxxxx you can handle this. My favorite thing about this new version is the stress management tool setxxxxx and is the reason I upgraded. Measuring my exercisexxxxx my sleepxxxxx and my heart rate are all important steps to my being able to manage my own health more effectively. I would recommend a Fitbit Sense to anyone managing heart issuesxxxxx as well as anyone just wanting to measure and manage their own health.
Great fitness tracker,5,Overall excellent fitness tracker for the price. I recently had a covid-19 scare and tracking my SpO2 during the night was very helpful. The mobile app is still very confusing if you want to get some metrics. I expected the battery life to be better than 4 days which I get from it. But that's also because I workout 6 days a week. I do like stress sessions and really feel it calms me downxxxxx have also been using the sleep sessions and those definitely get me more relaxed. The ecg monitor works well. I still don't know the use of the temperature sensor but if I had a fever I think this would be able to detect it. I'm still waiting for Google assistant and call answering on the fitbit directlyxxxxx it's not available as of yet.
USELESS WATCH.,1,I PURCHAED THIS WATCH MONTHS AGO. I FINALLY GOT IT YESTERDAY. SPENT HOURS TRYING TO USE IT. TALKED WITH FITBIT FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR. SHE COULDN'T HELP. DONT BUY THIS IT IS A USELESS PIECE.
My new Fitbit sense is awesome,5,I love the style and the functionality of the new Fitbit sense.
Please do not buy. You will regret it!!!!,2,First of allxxxxx this product fell short of my expectation in so many ways not after spending so much in acquiring it. First and major on my list is the fact that the Sense will not connect to a wireless earpiece or a headphone and thus one cannot use the music features on it. Secondlyxxxxx it disconnects from pairing mode intermittently with my mobile phone and I will have to unpair it and pair again with my phone (very frustrating i must say). Alsoxxxxx one cannot download personal songs to the sense except you use deezer or Spotify app on the sensexxxxx and it takes 30secs to get response from most apps. It's important to note that the response time of the screen is slow even when the clock face is a fitbit clock appxxxxx one has to tap multiple times before getting response and the Sense freezes in some instancexxxxx and reboots eventually. Seems to me that the Sense was not properly troubleshooted before been released into the market hurriedly. I feel ripped off of my hard earned money cos I have not gotten what I bargained for. I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT WORTH THE DEAL
Great advanced fitness help,5,Love having advanced Fitness information on.my wrist plus connection to Alexa and many other new features
Device with known defectsxxxxx released too soon.,2,The watch is nice looking itemxxxxx though there seems to be known defects that make the watch unreliable. My watchxxxxx like many other reported casesxxxxx often restarts on its own and gets stuck in boot loop. This happens while on wrist and on the charger. When happening at nightxxxxx sleep data is lost and only minimal information recorded. Fitbit tech help has been slow to respond on escalated casesxxxxx which makes keeping the item in hope of a resolution a risky endeavor. I love the watch despite the defects and hopeful I will get a resolution from tech support. I owning the watch past Amazon return date makes me pot committed here. I would however caution new purchases until the issue is addressed.
Fitbit Sense Advanced Smartwatch,1,If you are an Apple-centric householdxxxxx beware! We have only Catalina-based MAC computersxxxxx together with iPhones etc. The Sense was purchased for my wife. An account with Fitbit has to be opened using a MAC before the Sense can be used effectively with an iPhone - but Fitbit does not (yet?) creating an account under Catalina (which has been released for around a year. We returned the Sense to Amazonxxxxx and were very impressed by how easy Amazon made it! Thank you Amazon.
Best fitbit so far :),5,Everybody nitpicks about the little stuff like appearance and temp tracking at night or things like that but this watch is the best fitbit I've had so far. I'm in love with its quality and its so sleek and pretty.😍 I like how it is similar to the versa 3 but has its own unique qualities. Even though it was more expensivexxxxx over all its a great watch. 5 stars 🌟 👍
Still not ready for primetimexxxxx nice features but too rushed to market,1,Set up was easy and I like the idea of itxxxxx still has a lot of kinks to work out. Inconsistent chargingxxxxx you really have to make sure it is connecting properlyxxxxx battery drained quickly and the display would get stuck so you could no longer navigate and read the wrong time as if it need a rebootxxxxx I had to re-set twice and the last time decided to return. I do like the SO2 reading while sleeping and the temperature tracking would have been cool if it worked but doesn't display core temp just you temperature fluctuation. Mobile app is greatxxxxx sticking to my versa 2 for awhile to see if this one gets betterxxxxx having the versa 1 and 2 nowxxxxx along with many other fitbits I believe they will eventually work out the kinks
This my second replacement and it worked a few days longer than the original,1,I am so disappointed as I put in my order as soon as I read about the sense. I have other fitbits and they still work. THis watch will not stay on longer than a few hours even though it is set to ON This watch will not stay on medium visibility longer than a few hours And the most frustrating feature is the minutes that it takes to get the END feature to stop working after you finish a workout session. So Disappointed but Fitbit rushed this watch Great concept but to many bugs to deal with to keep I tried 2 times but both watches failed the test.
Best so far,5,I love this device! This one has so many bad reviews but don’t let them discourage you. I find that the ECG app is very reliable. My grandpa had his artery removed on one arm and the results were for a fib. The arm that has an artery came back as normal. The sleep tracker is reliable. As a person with a Chronic illnessxxxxx the heart rate tracker is great. It usually matches it within a 5 bpm rate. So glad I upgraded from the versa 2
The Sleep Tracking is changing my life!,5,The Sleep Tracking and Temperature monitoring are my favorite parts of this watch! I'm able to see how long I sleep and how wellxxxxx then compare the data to how I feel. I've been able to use it to get longer more restful sleep. Better sleep means a happier more productive day! My life is way too busy to use the exercise features but the watch is definitely prepared to motivate with reminders and how tos
Great smart watch but...,5,Directions need help. Got this two months and still need to look up how to use it from the internet. I printed the manual but it’s a bit confusing. I find myself also resetting it more than necessary to reconnect and sync with my iPad. Hoping software updates will remedy this. But on the totally positive side. I have AFIB and the Sense shows me without a doubt when I am in AFIB. I showed ecg print outs to my cardiologist and she was impressed with the print outs.
NOT impressed,2,Not impressedxxxxx Iv had it for about 3 weeksxxxxx the stress score and sleep tracker both suck! I have Been manually entering sleep and the sometimes I get A score and sometimes I dont. Iv called tech supportxxxxx if you are lucky enough to get someone you can actually understand on the phone they do nothing. Fitbit tech not amazon. This is my 5th Fitbit and by far the lowest reliability and highest price point. I’m going back to my HR inspire until they improve this.
Best Smartwatch Ever,5,Easy to usexxxxx comfortable to wearxxxxx very accurate with all of the health tools at your fingertips. Thank you FitBit
Never lets you down...,5,I’ve been wearing FitBit since the start. The new device doesn’t fail. If you’re in the familyxxxxx then you know this is a nice device. The mobile app is always helpful with decoding your metrics.
not worth the price,2,Bought with high expectations. Since Covid is so prevalent I wanted a watch that would monitor my temperature and oxygen level. Yes this watch does do these things but only if you are sleeping. I wanted a watch that would track thru my day. If I would have read the description better yes I would have seen that. So if you are wanted a watch that monitors thru the day this isn't the watch for you.
Must buy,5,Amazing watch. Some have mentioned the volume of data but I love itxxxxx especially the weekly summaries. My wife just got the latest apple watch and I'll try to update after I'm able to compare.
Inaccurate tracking - do not recommend!,1,I am a fan of Fitbit productsxxxxx but this is a huge disappointment. I have had this watch for less than 2 weeks and returning it. I know for sure the tracking is off for the stepsxxxxx stairs and heart rate are off. Such a disappointment.
Love this thing,5,I love how this fitbit works! I love that I can voice textxxxxx see who's callingxxxxx has multiple workouts programed in it instead of selecting what you want in the appxxxxx and how it calculates your sleep/SP02/sleep temp! Battery could be slightly better but lasts me about 4 days(due to it being Bluetoothed to my phone all day). It's just as good as my Charge 4!! I'd recommend it!!
Beyond impressive,5,Utility beyond my highest expections. Of course my only prior experience was with goolgle's software powered watches that were WEAK.
Bogus Heart rate data,1,Would give 0 stars if possible. Showing hear rate data when the watch is clearly not being worn. Some totally random numbers. Checked it multiple times. How am I supposed to believe any of the data produced in such manner where it tracks non existing data... Never had such problems with fitbit charge 4. It is pretty embarrassing really. You see this type of "quality" in $20 Chinese bands. Fitbit should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this.
Battery is excellentxxxxx watch and app user interface are intuitive.,4,Love the battery lifexxxxx so nice to use this Fitbit for a few days without worrying about recharging. It also charges very quickly. Battery is excellentxxxxx watch and app user interface are intuitive. Sleep tracking provides interesting information. The Fitbit works seamlessly with Strava for cyclingxxxxx hiking yoga... I have not used any of the dietxxxxx weightxxxxx water or stress management functions.
Do your research,5,I want to like this watch so much. Howeverxxxxx my fiancé has non-stop issues with syncing. Mine has been syncing okay and this might be because I’ve got an iPhone and he has an android. I’m a nurse so I really like to see the actually numbers (tempxxxxx Sp02 etc) and this device does not give me that. It just gives you a range and whether you’ve deviated from it. It records oxygenation and temperature only at nightxxxxx but you can log your temp if you have a thermometer. Alsoxxxxx the HR seems much higher than it is supposed to be. That being saidxxxxx I have a lot of hope for this watch. There are patches and updates in the near future and Google is in the process of acquiring Fitbit. This is a good thing...I think. There are so many things that I want to say about it but I’d suggest you just do research before purchasing. Make a list of what you want/need from a smartwatch and compare to what the Sense offers. I’ve only had this watch for a little over a week. The longer it records health dataxxxxx the more relevant the results will be. I’m going to stick it out and hope some of the major things are worked on; like HR accuracy and the syncing issues.
Excellent purchase,5,This is my 6th fitbit. My favorite so far. I like the additional health monitors.
Mistakes I've made.,1,My old Samsung that was replaced by the fit bit had a better app and tracked sleep better. The app is crap and won't keep a connection to the fit bit scalexxxxxno tracking of blood pressurexxxxx having to pay extra for premium features after dropping $$$ for a supposedly premium tracker.
Not as great as I hoped,3,Hi all! So it has been about a month with my new Sense (prior Fitbit was the Versa 2). Though not a fan of ratingxxxxx I felt it was needed this time. The Sense battery life could be betterxxxxx the vibrations need to be strongerxxxxx and the side button is not as intuitive as I feel it should bexxxxx based on previous Fitbits.
Great watch!,5,This has all the bells and whistles!
Love the Fitbit Sense!,5,I love the sleekness and all the apps that Sense offers. It’s also very comfortable! I’m anxious to receive the A-fib detector app.
Easy to use and a lot of health options,4,Only had it a few days but seems pretty accuratexxxxx my wife has one as well and is pleased as well.
Awesome,5,Awesome app. Great watch.
Beautiful designxxxxx amazing new features,5,Love the new design. Band is super-comfortable. ECG app easy to use. Stress management tools and EDA Scan app very helpful. 6 free months of Premium is great... lots of great extra insights and tools. Love the workout videos... especially helpful while I wait for my gym to re-open.
Fitbit upgrade,4,This fitbit should be easier to use it being the best available. The features listedxxxxx must be purchased in their app store. The SpO2 counter only works on sleepxxxxx not all the timexxxxx which isn't what was advertised. The screen and user interface is very touchy.
BASURA,1,Es una basura. Yo tuve el Versa 2 y estuvo perfecto por eso decidí comprarme este. Pero nada exacto para las pulsaciones ni para trackear el sueño. Se me salio una noche y aun asi marco como sí estuviera dormida. El versa 2 dejaba de trackear cuando se me salía y este no. Lo cambie porque creí que era un error y el segundo reloj que me llego es totalmente lo mismo. Es una decepción porque realmente me encanto el versa 2. El estetico es demasiado bonito y espero que resuelvan esto. Mientras tanto pedire rembolso y probare el garmin.
Use your phone,5,Love it
Loved it... not the side-effects,1,Loved itxxxxx did not love the side affects tho. Caused my whole arm and hand to become tingly and numb and hurt! Took days for the feeling to go away after taking it off! If they ever fix them so they no longer cause these issues id buy another one. A watch should not hurt you from wearing it!
Heart rate monitor while exercising is not accurate.,4,The heart rate monitor is not accurate while exercising. Hoping they will fix with software update soon. Doing very intense exercise it is still only showing 98-101 bpm. Then will skip to like 149 for a few mins then back to in the 90bpms. It’s one of the main reasons I bought it so It’s disappointing but tones of cool new features and the app is very user friendly. Might switch back to my Ionic though. The Ionic Heart rate monitor is on point.
Fitbit Sense a good tool for stayinh heathy.,4,I like the expanded health monotoring. Temperaturexxxxx heart rate and sleep patterns. It's also fun that one can control music with it. Its water resistance is appreciated since I can use it for all things except bathing and swimming.
Complicated,4,App and watch can be a bit complicated to get use to. Also have to have a subscription to get access to all the features of the sense. Battery life is ok could be better.
Superior Fitbit Device,5,I have been a Fitbit zealot for years. My upgrade was from a Versa 2 to a Sense and I could not be happier; especially in this pandemic day and age we are inxxxxx it is nice to have the advanced fitness/health tracking features.
Buen!,4,Muy bueno. Nunca antes había tenido un fitbit. Lo único negativo es que todavía no están algunas actualizaciones como el medidor del ritmo cardíacoxxxxx el nivel de oxigenación mientras duermes. Colorxxxxx perfectoxxxxx tamaño okxxxxx duración de batería va a depender mucho el uso que se le de. A mí me dura unos 4 a 5 días sin el "always on display" a veces cuesta que se sincronice pero no es algo de otro mundo.
Me gusta lo recomiendo,5,Entiendo que fueron poco más lejos con el sense lo único que después de 6 meses cobran ahora xxxxx algo que era de gratis
Great design with all the functionalities,5,It has all you needxxxxx very easy to usexxxxx confortable when exercising
So far so good,5,I like that it’s smaller than my last FitBit.
Love!,4,Still trying to figure everything out. I do like the sleep tracking and battery life. There isn't a paper instruction manual so I wish it did have one of those. Otherwise its nice watch and fun figuring everything out.
I like it so far,5,Definitely love the new features like the sp02 and temp. The swim tracking is a little off b it overall great watch
Fitbit Sense A+,5,Excellent training partner! Battery life is improved with this model!
Very good watch.,5,Only thing I'd like improved is a minute by minute graph of Sp02xxxxx where it currently only gives you a nightly average.
support is lacking,3,I love my Sense until I charge it and have to do a hard reset to get the Heart Rate monitor to work. I have contacted support so many times I have lost count and everyone has suggestions and no solutions. There is a problem with the watch and seemingly no solution. I am most frustrated with support.
Wonderful Cover.,5,Excellent product! Protects my Fitbit screen well. Easy to apply.
Nice upgrade!,5,I just upgraded to the Sense from the Ionic because of the ECG feature and Alexa app. Pleased so far.
Versa vs Sense,5,Awesone device as compared to my Versa. While the new features are awesome they clearly draw on power requiring more frequent charging. I used to charge my versus once a week or so ... the Sense is basically every 2 or 3 days. But do not let you stop from buying this unit. It is an very good product.
Very slickxxxxx amazing battery life,5,I have to charge it like an hour or so a weekxxxxx that's it! App works greatxxxxx pairs with my iPhone very well
Great Fitbit,5,It keep sleep tracking accurate as well as calories burned. The battery life lasts about 4 maybe 5 days.
GPS,5,The gps tracking upgrade is great.
Poor service from Fit Bit.,1,dead on arrival. talked to fit bit support and returned to them for replacement. Cannot get confirmation as to when replacement will be sent. Poor communication with them. Should have returned to Amason. HELP!!!!
Ok with iPhone,4,Does not sync well with iPhone for “find my phone” app. Battery life is much shorter than less sophisticated versions. Lots of cool functionsxxxxx though.
Worth it,5,Love all the updates. A great update to the versa 2
Greatxxxxx but unsyncs every night.,4,Every morningxxxxx I have to turn the watch off and back on in order for my S10 to recognize itxxxxx even though it can be seen in my bluetooth connections. I don't think I lose any dataxxxxx but it is just annoying. Otherwisexxxxx it is a terrific watch. I showed it to my doctor and he is going to buy one for his wife.
Worth the price tag.,5,I really enjoy the premium app features. Helps me keep track of my physical stats. I upgraded from Versa 2 and love all the new additions from this watch.
Great product,5,This product is awesomexxxxx highly recommend!!
Great watch,5,In absolutely in love with this watch. It's perfect for me.
Try Apple Watch.,4,Does not allow to answer and talk cell phone. Battery life about 72 hours. Does not allow Google Pay. Health tracking a little hokie.
Great hardware unfinished product,3,Hardware wise great product but lot of missing functionality. No ability to store own music or take a call. Had a speaker but is not enabled. Lot of sleep data but I would take music and phone call feature any day. Hopefully fitbit will realize it and will fix these issues in next few months.
Differences since Charge 3.,4,The sleep tracking is less accurate than the Charge 3 & the SPO2 only works if you wear that clock face. Howeverxxxxx I do like the Breathing Ratexxxxx Heart arate Variability & Skin Temp.
great gift for girlfriend,5,Got this as a present for my very active girlfriendxxxxx so far it is everything she wanted it to be
Needs better clock faces,3,It seems to be behind in its tracking but I’ve only had it for 3 days
It just work,5,Don’t listen to all the negative reviewsxxxxx the Fitbit Sense works and it works very well.
Nice 👍🏾,4,I just got this less a week ago. Ask me in a month !
Too many bugs,2,Inconsistent. Doesn’t always track SP02. Can only use one clock face to track your SP02. Have to tap multiple times to wake the screen. Can’t easily slide from screen to screen; it gets stuck on a screen and you just have to wait. Does not accurately track treadmill steps or distance and there is no way to change it on the app.
Fitbit sense,5,I like the health apps on the the Fitbit sense and the accuracy of the data so far
Just a rough measurement of biometricsxxxxx not truly accurate,4,Does what I need it forxxxxx ekg reader is a little weak in readingxxxxx gets a lot of inconclusive results
Sense Love,5,Functionalityxxxxx comfort wearxxxxx great reports
Sensible,5,Comfortable with lots of capabilities
